## Full-Text Search

> Starting from version 2.4, MongoDB began with an experimental feature supporting Full-Text Search using Text Indexes. This feature has now become an integral part of the product (and is no longer an experimental feature). In this article we are going to explore the full-text search functionalities of MongoDB right from fundamentals.

> Before MongoDB came up with the concept of text indexes, we would either model our data to support [keyword searches](http://docs.mongodb.org/master/tutorial/model-data-for-keyword-search/) or use [regular expressions](http://docs.mongodb.org/master/reference/operator/query/regex/#op._S_regex) for implementing such search functionalities.

See reference below for more info.
